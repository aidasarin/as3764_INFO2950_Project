# INFO2950-Project

by Aida Sarinzhipova (as3764) and Kyuman Kim (kk946)

This project was created with the purpose of finding certain popularity trends of movie genres overtime (1927-2016), using a representative sample slice of movies taken from IMDB database.
Other research questions involved figuring out how the genre of a movie influences the movie's success in both financial and ranking terms, as well as how the popularity of one movie genre affected the rise and fall of other genres. 

The dataset was created for the purpose of finding the genres trends in the film industry and delivering valuable information for both movie suppliers and consumers. Understanding the general historical movie trends within the entertainment industry is crucial for the success of young or future movie directors, producers, and screenwriters. These people may benefit by creating movies based on the genres that are extremely profitable or are currently trending.

The project involved some data manipulation such as preprocessing and cleaning. Moreover, there were two types of analyses performed on the cleaned version of the datasets, apart from just general statistics and overview of movie genres:

#### Analysis 1: Linear Regression - Establishing Genre Popularity Trends
#### Analysis 2: Linear Regression with Budget and Revenue Raised By Each Genre

## Key Findings

Our research showed that different genres have different effect on their movies' performance. For the biggest genres like Action, Adventure, Drama, Thriller, Romance, the producers can expect bigger popularity if they initially invest more money into the film production process.
Drama was indeed the most prevalent genre during the entire time period with stable financial performance and high vote average over the years. Family appeared to be the most lucrative genre with the highest return on investment. Choosing Animation genre would bring good reviews and recognition to the movie producers. Thriller and Romance experienced downfall overtime, and their profitability is worse compared to the other big genres. Comedy movies had one of the lowest recognition and profitability, and thus would not be included in the popularity trend at all.
